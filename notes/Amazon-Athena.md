# Amazon Athena

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena at your data stored in Amazon S3 and begin using standard SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds.

Amazon Athena also makes it easy to interactively run data analytics using Apache Spark without having to plan for, configure, or manage resources. When you run Apache Spark applications on Athena, you submit Spark code for processing and receive the results directly.

Athena SQL and Apache Spark on Amazon Athena are serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage, and you pay only for the queries you run.
