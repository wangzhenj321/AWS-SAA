# AWS DataSync

AWS DataSync is an online data movement and discovery service that simplifies data migration and helps you quickly, easily, and securely transfer your file or object data to, from, and between AWS storage services.

## Use cases

- Discover data – Get visibility into your on-premises storage performance and utilization. AWS DataSync Discovery can also provide recommendations for migrating your data to AWS storage services.

- Migrate data – Move active datasets rapidly over the network into AWS storage services. DataSync includes automatic encryption and data integrity validation to help make sure that your data arrives securely, intact, and ready to use.

- Archive cold data – Move cold data stored in on-premises storage directly to durable and secure long-term storage classes such as S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive. Doing so can free up on-premises storage capacity and shut down legacy systems.

- Replicate data – Copy data into any Amazon S3 storage class, choosing the most cost-effective storage class for your needs. You can also send data to Amazon EFS, FSx for Windows File Server, FSx for Lustre, or FSx for OpenZFS for a standby file system.

- Move data for timely in-cloud processing – Move data in or out of AWS for processing. This approach can speed up critical hybrid cloud workflows across many industries. These include machine learning in the life-sciences industry, video production in media and entertainment, big-data analytics in financial services, and seismic research in the oil and gas industry.
