## What is network-attached storage?

Network-attached storage (NAS) is a file-dedicated storage device that makes data continuously available for employees to collaborate effectively over a network. Any computer network has interconnected server machines and client machines that send requests to the servers. NAS devices are specialized servers that handle only data storage and file-sharing requests. They provide fast, secure, and reliable storage services to private networks.
