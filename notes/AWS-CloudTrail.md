# AWS CloudTrail

## What are CloudTrail events?

An event in CloudTrail is the record of an activity in an AWS account. This activity can be an action taken by an IAM identity, or service that is monitorable by CloudTrail.

There are three types of events that can be logged in CloudTrail:

- management events

    Management events provide information about management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. These are also known as *control plane operations*.

- data events

    Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or in a resource. These are also known as *data plane operations*.

- Insights events

    CloudTrail Insights events capture unusual API call rate or error rate activity in your AWS account by analyzing CloudTrail management activity.
