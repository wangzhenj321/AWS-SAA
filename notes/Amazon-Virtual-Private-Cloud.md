### Connect your VPC to other networks

- internet gateway

    An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

- egress-only internet gateway

    An egress-only internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, and prevents the internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances.

- NAT device

    You can use a NAT device to allow resources in private subnets to connect to the internet, other VPCs, or on-premises networks. These instances can communicate with services outside the VPC, but they cannot receive unsolicited connection requests.

    You can use a managed NAT device offered by AWS, called a *NAT gateway*, or you can create your own NAT device on an EC2 instance, called a *NAT instance*.

    NAT devices are not supported for IPv6 trafficâ€”use an egress-only internet gateway instead.

    - NAT gateway

        - Public

            Instances in private subnets can connect to the internet through a public NAT gateway, but cannot receive unsolicited inbound connections from the internet. You create a public NAT gateway in a public subnet and must associate an elastic IP address with the NAT gateway at creation. You route traffic from the NAT gateway to the internet gateway for the VPC. Alternatively, you can use a public NAT gateway to connect to other VPCs or your on-premises network. In this case, you route traffic from the NAT gateway through a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway.

        - Private

            Instances in private subnets can connect to other VPCs or your on-premises network through a private NAT gateway. You can route traffic from the NAT gateway through a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway. You cannot associate an elastic IP address with a private NAT gateway. You can attach an internet gateway to a VPC with a private NAT gateway, but if you route traffic from the private NAT gateway to the internet gateway, the internet gateway drops the traffic.

- transit gateway

    You can connect your virtual private clouds (VPC) and on-premises networks using a transit gateway, which acts as a central hub, routing traffic between VPCs, VPN connections, and AWS Direct Connect connections.

- AWS Virtual Private Network

- VPC peering

    A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. Resources in peered VPCs can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS Region. Traffic between peered VPCs never traverses the public internet.

## AWS PrivateLink

AWS PrivateLink is a highly available, scalable technology that you can use to privately connect your VPC to services as if they were in your VPC. You do not need to use an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to allow communication with the service from your private subnets. Therefore, you control the specific API endpoints, sites, and services that are reachable from your VPC.

### VPC endpoints

A service consumer creates a VPC endpoint to connect their VPC to an endpoint service.

- `Interface`

    Create an *interface endpoint* to send TCP traffic to an endpoint service. Traffic destined for the endpoint service is resolved using DNS.

- `GatewayLoadBalancer`

    Create a *Gateway Load Balancer endpoint* to send traffic to a fleet of virtual appliances using private IP addresses.

There is another type of VPC endpoint, `Gateway`, which creates a *gateway endpoint* to send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB. Gateway endpoints do not use AWS PrivateLink, unlike the other types of VPC endpoints.
