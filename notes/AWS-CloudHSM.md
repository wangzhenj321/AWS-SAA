# AWS CloudHSM

AWS CloudHSM combines the benefits of the AWS cloud with the security of hardware security modules (HSMs). A hardware security module (HSM) is a computing device that processes cryptographic operations and provides secure storage for cryptographic keys. With AWS CloudHSM, you have complete control over high availability HSMs that are in the AWS Cloud, have low-latency access, and a secure root of trust that automates HSM management (including backups, provisioning, configuration, and maintenance).
